# FALCON Digital Signal Processing (DSP) Library

## Overview
The **libfalcon\_dsp** library provides various Digital Signal Processing routines
 that I have found useful.

## Dependencies
The **libfalcon\_dsp** library depends on several other FALCON libraries. The following
 table lists the libraries and the currently supported version/tag/sha of each library.
 Note that other library versions may work as well, but the versions from this table
 are used in the current unit tests and builds.
